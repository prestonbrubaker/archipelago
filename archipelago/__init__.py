#This is a global __init__ file. It will serve to allow for the global 
#importation of our modules which may be used across our applications. 
#This is especially important as we consider the division of scripts. It 
#allows us to work independently and more efficiently within the same file. 
#Keeps things better organized. Cleaner structure. This aside, good practice. 
#I LOVE YOU, PRESTON SCOTT!
